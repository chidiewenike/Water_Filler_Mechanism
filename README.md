# Water_Filler

Simple automated robotic water filler for a simple fridge water dispenser. The water is dispensed at a constant rate which was a calculated average and the size of bottle to be filled is then determined. Using the size of the bottle and the known amount of water dispensed per second, we can find the time required to fill the bottle.

The "arm" is controlled by two servo motors connected to an Arduino. The "LCD" display provides the user the options to choose from and the button allows the user to select his/her desired fill amount. The "arm" will then rotate and push the water dispenser and begin filling the bottle. The bottle will then rotate back once finished.
